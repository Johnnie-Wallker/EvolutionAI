# ===================================================================
# .gitignore for including ONLY specific folders
# ===================================================================

# 1. Ignore everything in the project by default.
*

# 2. Now, create exceptions for the folders you want to keep.
# The "!" character means "do NOT ignore".
# We need to un-ignore both the directory and all of its contents recursively (/**).
!/experiments/
!/experiments/**
!/utils/
!/utils/**
!requirements.txt

# 3. It's important to also un-ignore this .gitignore file itself!
!.gitignore

# 4. (Optional but Recommended) Re-ignore common files you don't want,
# even if they are inside your included folders.
